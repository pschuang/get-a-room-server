## üåê Summary

This is a matchmaking website hosted on AWS EC2, built with Node.js and Express as the backend framework, React as the frontend, MySQL and Redis as the databases. I use Websockets for real-time chat and dayjs and crontab for managing time logic behind the scenes.

## üìÇ Introduction

### Synopsis

A matchmaking platform based on an anonymous question-answer game, which brings a quality time of 15 minutes everyday for users to get to know a new friend starting from a specific topic.

### What brought me this idea?

Social media and dating apps have evolved to become platforms for people to meet up, and finding matches with people online has become much easier in recent years. **"Dating app fatigue"** refers to people using dating app get overwhelmed by the sheer number of potential matches, leading them to lose focus and become unable to commit to any one person.

As a result, I came up with this idea of creating a platform where people can **match only once a day**. Moreover, A match happens when a user who posted the question picks a reply from another user, and then both can start a chatroom with time limit. 

With this design, I want to create connections between users based on topics that interest them, and build a place where users can focus on talking to a person per day.





## üî∏ User Flow
#### Playground rule
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5IlWk25.png" width="50%"  />
</div>
<br/>

```
1. Bulletin open for 20 mins, once a day.
2. You can post 1 question and reply to multiple questions everyday.
3. Pick a reply. If the replier is online, they will get notified.
4. Once matched, you can chat with counterpart for 15 mins.
5. When match ends, both users can decide whether to be friends in 30 seconds.
6. You can chat with your friends whenever you want.
7. Either by picking a replier or getting picked, you can only be matched once per day.
```

> **Warning**
>
> For viewers to better understand the project, and play with the features:
> 1. Bulletin now is open **from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m**.
> 2. Time limit of matching chatroom is shortened to **15 seconds**.

## üé® Features

### Questions

- Category Filter & Search
- Load more to view more questions

### Chatroom

#### <ins>In general</ins>

- Real-time chat between two users by`Socket.IO`
- Show messages with time


#### <ins>Chatroom with friends</ins>

- Store chat history
- Show friends' online | offline status

![](https://i.imgur.com/LWHNQal.png)


#### <ins>Temporary chatroom with matched counterpart</ins>

- Notify users when counterpart joins / leaves chatroom
- Counting down timer starts right after replier joined chatroom
- When time's up, both users will be asked if they want to be friends or not

### Bulletin Time Limit
Use `Day.js` to deal with dates and times and measure time in <i>UTC</i>

- Build a middleware to block request not within the bulletin open time
- Show questions created on the same day
- Randomly generate bulletin open time everyday by`Crontab`

### Matching Mechanism

Use `Redis` for real-time data analysis
- Users can view their questions and pick a replier to go to chat
- Only online users can be picked
- Users can only be matched once per day
- Once matched, both users enter a chatroom open for 15 minutes
- When time's up and if both agree, both become friends


> `user1 (left)` creates reply -> `user2 (right)` views replies and pick `user1` -> `user1` gets notified

> `user1 (left)` enters chatroom -> both starts chatting -> time's up and both agree to be friend

### Dashboard
Implement dashboard's real-time data display by `Socket.IO`

- Demonstrate data for monitoring the website
    - Instant data: Online user counts, matching situation
    - Statistics for the day (refreshed constantly): New register counts, question counts, percentage of question categories, closed question counts, reply counts, new friendship counts
    - Weekly statistics: Page views per day, question total counts per day
- Authorization: Only users assigned admin role can get access to dashboard
- Charts (Doughnut Chart, Line Chart, Bar Chart) are created with `Chart.js`
- Updates page views on hourly basis by `Crontab`

### Sign in / Sign up
Use `JSON Web Token` for authentication 

## üîπ Architecture Diagram

- Configures Nginx as reverse proxy to handle incoming requests
- Uses Express as backend framework, React as frontend
- Leverages MySQL to store and retrieve data to provide API service 
- Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between client and server with Websocket
- Utilize Redis to store disposable data in memory with expiration time, in order to reduce burden on MySQL
